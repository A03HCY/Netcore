# Architecture Overview

Netcore employs a three-layer architecture designed for maximum flexibility and extensibility.

## Layer Structure

### 1. Protocol Layer (LSO)
The bottom layer handles data serialization and protocol implementation:
- Binary protocol with extensible headers
- Support for both memory and file-based storage
- Data chunking for large transfers
- Data integrity verification

### 2. Transport Layer (Pipe)
The middle layer provides abstract transport interfaces:
- Unified send/receive interface
- Asynchronous queue management
- Mission-based data transfer
- Built-in error handling

### 3. Application Layer (Endpoint)
The top layer manages application logic:
- Message routing system
- Request-response handling
- Asynchronous callbacks
- Global request context
